# Android project using Flow, Mortar and Dagger

This is an attempt to create a starter project for Android using Flow 1.0.0-alpha2, Mortar 0.20 and Dagger 2.8.

I do not fully understand yet how to use Dagger 2 so what I did for now is just put all the .inject() in MainComponent. If you have any suggestions on how to fix it, please tell me.

If you have any suggestions on how to make this sample app better, please tell me also.
